 # Food-Delivery-Website
#Introduction

Introduction 1.1 Purpose The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive overview of the requirements for the development of the Food Delivery Website. It outlines the features, functionalities, constraints, and specifications necessary for the successful implementation of the system.
1.2 Scope The Food Delivery Website is intended to be an online platform that facilitates the purchase and delivery of Food. It targets users who seek a convenient and time-saving alternative to traditional Food shopping.

#Existing System 2. Existing System Overview 2.1 System Architecture The existing system follows a client-server architecture. The front-end is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the back-end uses PHP and a MySQL database.

2.2 Key Features 1.User Registration and Authentication 2.Product Browsing and Search 3.Shopping Cart Management 4.Checkout and Payment Processing 5.Order Placement and Confirmation 6.Basic Order Tracking 7.Limited User Feedback

#Proposed System 3. Proposed System Overview 3.1 System A1`rchitecture The proposed system maintains the existing client-server architecture but upgrades technologies. The front-end will use React.js for improved interactivity, and the back-end will transition to Node.js for enhanced scalability.

3.2 Key Features 1.Advanced User Registration and Authentication 2.Enhanced Product Browsing and Search with AI-powered Recommendations 3.Robust Shopping Cart Management with Quick Add and Smart Suggestions 4.Secure Checkout with Multiple Payment Gateways 5.Real-Time Order Placement and Confirmation 6.Comprehensive Real-Time Order Tracking with Geo-location 7.Rich User Feedback and Reviews 8.Admin Dashboard for Streamlined Management 9.Improved Delivery Logistics Integration 10.Mobile-First Design for Optimal Responsiveness 11.Enhanced Security Measures
